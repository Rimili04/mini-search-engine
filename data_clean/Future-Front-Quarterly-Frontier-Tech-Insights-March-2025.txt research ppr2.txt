systems faster than previously anticipated in this context topology refers to a branch of mathematics dealing with properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations such as stretching or twisting this principle enables topological qubits to store information in a way that is inherently protected from external disturbances unlike traditional qubits which are highly sensitive to environmental noise and decoherence topological qubits are envisioned to rely on exotic quasiparticles known as majorana zero modes mzms which are their own antiparticles and can exist at the ends of specially engineered nanowires quantum information is stored across pairs of these mzms making it more robust against errors indium arsenide nanowires coated with aluminium are commonly used as
