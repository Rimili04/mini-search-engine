pinky anand the march of the indian republic has been extraordinary we are called a subcontinent and as a subcontinent we have challenges that are diverse and often difficult as they have no precedent with time we have navigated these challenges trying to create a balance which reflects not only our individual identities but also our collective identities and aspirations as a nation 10 journal of the harvard club of india india at 75 he indian republic is a hard won battle by the incomparable dr b r ambedkar our with memories of an overlord ruling constitution is a tome aspiring to keep at its core our lands still alive the annexation basic human rights and principles ensuring to of india started with the victory of us human and fundamental rights and acting as robert clive the first british governor the parens patriae latin for parent of the people of the bengal presidency over nawab to its citizens siraj ud daulah the last independent nawab of bengal in 1757 india was reaching out to the people then slowly but surely annexed to the extent that by the historic battle of 1857 the populism and populist policies served us well country was left as an economic gold mine for during our fight for independence the father of the the biggest corporate of the time the east india nation mohandas karamchand gandhi popularly company india was subsequently taken over by known as the mahatma was behind one of the the british crown and became a part of the various largest mass movements in the indian freedom colonies of great britain struggle the civil disobedience movement later it is in this context that i believe india s also became a template for the south african freedom is hard earned after our territories freedom struggle and was greatly lauded for its having been annexed for more than 200 years principles of non violence and effectiveness india launched one of the biggest revolts in living populist ideology was writ large in gandhi s anti memory today when we look back at it we can modernist rhetoric and was an effective tool to bring see that for a country as wide and as diverse as the the british government to its knees it launched an indian subcontinent it was a very difficult move offensive that aligned all sections of society from the mass uprisings and rebellion have given us the educated elites to the farmers artisans and india or bharat it was indeed a battle well fought landowners it has to be agreed that it was only on freedom however was merely the first step the back of these movements that india s freedom we were free from foreign yoke no doubt but for a was achieved and thus the constitution framed country to be truly free there has to be freedom in promising our citizens that the government would the minds of its citizens there has to be harmony be for the people by the people and of the people and a feeling of belongingness to a country and a this was reflected in the document drafted sense of duty towards its society to achieve that although the indian nation was built on a goal the fledgling state of india commissioned populist movement there is always a distinction a body to create the indian constitution headed between populist and popular the difference lies in a leader or a government after our territories having been annexed that undertakes roles that might be for more than 200 years india launched one difficult or not appeal to a section of of the biggest revolts in living memory today people but have an overall positive when we look back at it we can see that for a impact on the state strong leaders country as wide and as diverse as the indian are often not populist but they are subcontinent it was a very difficult move usually popular and in retrospect the indian republic today work in progress 11 are remembered for their decisions which at that real world applications of these principles are a time may have received substantial criticism the different ball game altogether political conduct of these leaders reflect their there exists a contrarian view on the subject authenticity in taking decisions that might not which states that ideas such as constitutional appeal to some sections of the society we can easily morality are subjective and widen the scope for see that the idea of vote bank politics does not play judicial discretion delay and the uncertainty of a very large role in their election campaigns law the need for constitutional morality however is reflected in the following incident while moving cultivating constitutional morality the draft constitution in 1948 dr ambedkar quoted george grote the english historian who today when independent india is 75 years old was noted for his works on ancient greece the it has become more important than ever for constitutional morality not merely among the us to look deep into our painstakingly drafted majority of any community but throughout the constitution and embody and bring to the fore its whole is an indispensable condition of government true essence the building pillar of our constitution at once free and peaceable since even any is its essence what we very recently have come to powerful and obstinate minority may render the debate as constitutional morality working of a free institution impracticable without constitutional morality means adherence to being strong enough to conquer the ascendancy the core principles of constitutional democracy for themselves the question that often plagues us is whether it is if we do not adhere to the essence of the a subjective idea or an objective one does it limit constitution and interpret it without following the itself simply to the provisions and the writ of the ideology behind it it is quite possible to pervert constitution or does it have a subjective quality the constitution without changing its form that to it taking on its own life and applying itself to is what is taking place in india that was exactly the changing social dynamics of today s world what adolf hitler did in germany without altering while deriving its essence from the thread writ in the form of the weimar constitution he destroyed our constitution at 75 i think the country has now the entire constitutional spirit and ultimately found its answer time and again interpreting the the constitution itself professor wadhwa in constitution as a living breathing body capable of d c wadhwa vs state of bihar quotes the roman applying itself to the challenges of the new world legalist julius paulus 204 bc one who does yet always keeping in mind its basic nature and what a statute forbids transgresses the statute preserving its core essential values the concept one who contravenes the intention of a statute of constitutional morality however does not limit without disobeying its actual words commits a itself to simply human rights it encompasses fraud on it within its paradigm constitutional values such as our constitution has been drafted for the the rule of law social justice democratic ethos better administration of the country when popular popular participation in governance individual ideologies emotions and sentiments are muddled freedom judicial independence egalitarianism up it leads to subjectivity of judicial decisions and sovereignty though its meaning is clear the causing the interpretation to be populist rather 12 journal of the harvard club of india india at 75 than an attempt to interpret the we call the constitution the sovereign intention behind the constitution power of our nation and hence it becomes if all judgments are given on the necessary for the judiciary to keep in mind its basis of popular view or personal or basic structure while rendering decisions the natural sentiment then the primary judiciary has the onerous task to sometimes reason for which the constitution give decisions that might not seem to was drafted will be violated there be acceptable will be no uniform platform or guidelines for imparting justice and all decisions this trend is evident from the path breaking will be personally inclined the morals of a society judgments that derive their essence from the or any group of people are at best dynamic they fountainhead of constitutional morality the court change from time to time depending on the relied on the doctrine to strike down the age old prevailing circumstances or the environment in inequitable practice of triple talaq another which these are created an example that has judgment was the sabarimala one although i have always remained in my mind regarding this is what a caveat as it is in review before the supreme i was told about afghanistan a few decades ago court the core of these judgments was the it was a hub of knowledge and had a chic society same to uphold the idea of equality and freedom if i may be excused for the term women used of religious practice although these principles are to drive nightclubs were open to both sexes and not specifically addressed in the constitution they kabul had a roaring nightlife today this society have evolved drawing from this core value lies desolate and war torn the entire thought in the sabarimala judgment the conundrum process of what is acceptable or not has changed was the bar of the entry of women in the temple in the years of strife that the country has of lord ayyappa by legal sanction by rule 3 b unfortunately suffered of the kerala hindu places of public worship authorisation of entry rules 1965 the validity of interpreting the constitution the rule and other provisions restricting the entry of women was decided by the supreme court we call the constitution the sovereign power of a constitution bench of the supreme court in our nation and hence it becomes necessary for sabarimala followed the path of ambedkar the the judiciary to keep in mind its basic structure court by a majority of 4 1 struck down the practice while rendering decisions the judiciary has the that barred the entry of women into sabarimala it onerous task to sometimes give decisions that held that the exclusion of women between the ages might not seem to be acceptable but it has to of 10 and 50 years from entering the shrine violates balance these notions of custom to the essence of the constitution and its guarantee for equality and what the indian constitution holds the judiciary non discrimination on the basis of gender also has the unenviable duty to try and interpret another landmark judgment which recognised the constitution in a way that upholds the current the essence of the constitution was navtej singh morals of society constitutional morality lends johar vs union of india where section 377 of the itself to this complex process indian penal code was read down to exclude the the indian republic today work in progress 13 victorian mores of homosexuality being a sin and it is not left to majoritarian governments illegal the supreme court drew upon this doctrine to prescribe what shall be orthodox in matters to evolve freedom of choice to decriminalise concerning social morality the fundamental homosexuality and uphold the human right to be rights chapter is like the north star in the universe able to choose your own sexual partner the chief of constitutionalism he emphasised justice of india while debating on the nature of the another paradigm shift ushered in was constitution stated constitutional morality is not the decriminalisation of adultery adultery was confined to the literal text of the constitution rather criminalised in the indian penal code since its it must seek to usher in a pluralistic and inclusive inception and in the statutes before unfortunately society it is the responsibility of all three organs the criminality attached to the offence was created of the state to curb any propensity or proclivity of in such a way that only the man responsible was popular sentiment or majoritarianism any attempt liable for any action of adultery the all pervasive to push and shove a homogeneous uniform victorian ideal that women do not have the consistent and a standardised philosophy would agency to choose to be in a relationship outside violate constitutional morality freedom of choice the marriage or even be in a position to make the cannot be scuttled or abridged on the threat of choice to be involved with a married man was criminal prosecution and made paraplegic on the the theme song with the change in times and the mercurial stance of majoritarian perception feminist movement the ideal was displaced and as a testament to the dynamic nature of the debunked however the law remained static in india constitution justice rohinton nariman concisely the supreme court keeping in mind the principles explained the rationale for reading down the indian of equality and its new world applications refused penal code holding that homosexuality is not a to allow the law to continue deeming it in violation psychiatric disorder and that same sex sexuality of our constitution is a normal variant of human sexuality much like justice chandrachud in his concurring heterosexuality and bisexuality also there is no judgment held that the law was also based on scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be sexual stereotypes that view women as being altered by treatment justice nariman relied on passive and devoid of sexual agency he held that the latin maxim cessante ratione legis cessat there was manifest arbitrariness in section 497 ispa lex when the reason for a law ceases the which deprived a woman of her agency autonomy law itself ceases to strike down section 377 the and dignity section 497 lacks an adequately rationale for the section victorian morality had determining principle to criminalise consensual long passed he said sexual activity and is manifestly arbitrary he said justice chandrachud also questioned the chief justice of india while debating how the law failed to recognise the on the nature of the constitution stated agency of a woman whose spouse constitutional morality is not confined to was engaged in a sexual relationship the literal text of the constitution rather outside of marriage according it must seek to usher in a pluralistic and to justice misra parameters of inclusive society fundamental rights should include 14 journal of the

annals and creating a women unequally women can t be asked to think law for mandatory education a huge reason why what a society desires india was viewed as the land of snake charmers both these judgments regarding the was due to the lack of formal global education decriminalisation of adultery and homosexuality while our ancient texts and scriptures are superior drew from the aadhar judgment recognising the to many it was the lack of global education that right to privacy as a fundamental one held us back education was also necessary to improve opportunity access to our masses and upholding the constitution an important tool to improve if not eradicate the menace of poverty that has plagued our country for our nation has three pillars of governance the as long as memory goes this was in furtherance legislature the executive and the judiciary in layman to mohini jain vs state of karnataka in 1992 when terms we understand the role of these as the the supreme court interpreted the constitution to legislature makes the laws the executive executes have in itself the implied right to education as a the laws and the judiciary upholds the laws it is fundamental right under article 21a in this third pillar that constitutional morality lies the supreme court has been instrumental the conscience of the judiciary is reflected in the in several such laws where the constitution has way the constitution is upheld and interpreted been interpreted to have contained within itself dr ambedkar raised the question of whether we rights such as the right to clean air or the right could presume such a diffusion of constitutional to livelihood despite the letter of law not having morality when he stated constitutional morality spelled it out in as many words is not a natural sentiment it has to be cultivated independent india at 75 is a work in we must realise that our people have yet to learn progress we laid down the structure of our it democracy in india is only a top dressing on country in 1947 and from there it has been an indian soil which is essentially undemocratic a constant endeavour to create adapt and he ended by observing in these circumstances reinvent a dynamic constitution consistent with it is wiser not to trust the legislature to prescribe the evolutionary process of the times and the forms of administration this is the justification for demands of civil society there are multiple lines incorporating them in the constitution along which india can be divided in the face of all another significant stride taken by the indian the diversities in contemporary india with all its republic is according the status of fundamental varied cultures religions worldviews there is one thing that holds the nation we laid down the structure of our country together and it is constitutional in 1947 and from there it has been a constant morality for a society as endeavour to create adapt and reinvent a pluralistic as india to function dynamic constitution consistent with the and thrive there has to be an evolutionary process of the times and the acceptance of individual identities demands of civil society further a balance needs to be the indian republic today work in progress 15 maintained between the needs of the individual would themselves not go to the temple their faith and the collective otherwise there will be no would not allow it the triple talaq judgment dealt peace and no stability the judgments of the with the extreme razor thin line between religion supreme court in sabarimala triple talaq as well and rights accorded in a secular society the thread as the decriminalisation of homosexuality may that emerges is that populism may not produce not adhere to the popular view of society indeed the desired goals of equality and good conscience they have been deeply controversial and have in consonant with current day ethos this is where essence divided factions of the population there constitutional morality kicks in to forge the way was a furore over sabarimala temple entry some ahead and bridge the gap between yesterday claiming that the true women devotees of ayyappa today and tomorrow pinky anand was

has turned me region all that much more dangerous in the post from my determined belief that the united states american period in afghanistan needs to chart as independent and neutral a rendering this

misinformation and tendentious invaders and finally had he not referred the issue interpretation of events have often blurred historical to the united nations facts while unsolicited offers of

retrospectively the and india did not intervene it can safely be said that thought process is born out of a conflict between if pakistan had not forced hari singh s hand the fate fiction and reality between perception and truth of j k would have been decided after a leisurely between objectivity and bias process of cogitation by hari singh of the pros and the historical fact however is that out of the cons of joining india or pakistan the fact remains 565 princely states in india jammu and kashmir that he acceded to india and signed the same was the only state whose relationship with the instrument of accession that other princely states indian union had not been decided at the time had signed with the same caveats on october 26 of its independence as the ruling maharaja hari 1947

liberal and flexible attitude towards agreements abdullah asked for a vote for jammu and kashmir treaties signed in the past through a legitimate being an integral part of india in an overwhelming process is that there is no finality about any such mandate through an internationally acknowledged decision and it has to be endorsed by every new free and fair choice the people of jammu kashmir generation this thinking can lead to instability and and ladakh voted for sheikh mohammad abdullah is dangerous but for argument s sake even if this and his national conference party to govern were accepted to be the norm in international law the state as part of the republic of india this it has already been tested in the context of jammu watershed milestone was the last in the chequered and

cooperatives serving their needs for technical and to credit or raw materials or information know managerial assistance in production and marketing how or market infrastructure grassroots workers while sewa bank provides the financial services at national and international levels are involved in cooperatives and trade unions are two formulating policies hence as a representative structures which satisfy the needs of women organisation of self employed workers we have to workers and small producers of the weaker be effective at all these levels sections because these organisations are member owned member controlled and democratic in planning for the future nature they are both part of already established mainstream national and international structures the future of women workers or in fact all workers with networks all the way down to their members is the most challenging today some basics of both cooperatives and trade unions started as trade unionism are changing with globalisation movements of the poor disadvantaged working through the enormous increase in the power of class it is only in the last few decades that trade transnational corporations there is a decline in the unions have become a movement limited to those state s role of administering the social compromise in the formal sector that is in industrial plants and which the transnational capital no longer needs offices and cooperatives a vehicle for mostly the because it now operates at a global level where it better off farmers and traders we need to go to can escape the political control of society at the the roots of the cooperatives which arose from the national level also trade unionism is changing labour movement and will change further through the rise of a global interaction between cooperatives and trade labour market countries underbid each other in unions is mutually strengthening to each other an effort to preserve or attract foreign investment seeking visibility and a voice 41 at the end it is the workers who interaction between cooperatives and trade suffer this is why the challenge unions is mutually strengthening to each of the globalisation of capital is other in order to make a dent in the national above all a challenge of unions economy and in raising the bargaining power internationalism in fact it seems as well as the political visibility of the poor that a real trade union movement is yet to be built the good news is that workers in the informal therefore we as women workers have to employment are taking the situation into their consider a political agenda a trade union agenda own hands being workers they do what workers and most important an organising agenda at a do naturally whenever they have a chance world level only 13 per cent or so of wage workers they organise are organised into unions and if the informal sector successful organising in the informal sector is added this figure would drop to 4 or 5 per cent and also in the service trades means women in japan it fell from 56 per cent to 25 per cent in the trade union movement if we are serious during the last decade and in the usa it fell from about organising the majority of workers it needs 35 to 13 per cent northern europe is an exception to open the unions far more to women than has where the workers have held their own been the case so far we women need to enter the much of this has to do with the changing union movement in a big number our number has structure of the enterprise most companies are been in the informal sector not the formal sector reducing direct employment to a core workforce because a vast majority of workers in the informal and then subcontracting their operations a modern sector are women including all those in casual company is mainly the coordinator and the work temporary part time employment opening trade is done on its behalf by others sub contracting unions to the informal sector workers or women cascades down from one sub contractor to the not only means taking them on board along other eventually ending up with the home based with the specific demands of women but also worker with conditions and wages worsening as changing the work style and the culture of the one moves to the outer circle trade unions movement what the unions have not done is to follow their these workers rarely engage in typical members and to follow the work their membership collective bargaining although they do social has shrunk as has their core constituency this is bargaining this calls for a re thinking on what is a the story of industrialised countries we in india worker and what is a union this kind of organising too are moving on the same track for this reason can only be done by unions that see themselves as a the organising of the informal sector is a vital social movement it cannot be done by companies necessity for the trade union movement also in this brings me to our structures we need to ask what remains of the formal sector the informal ourselves whether our present structures are the sector is growing everywhere in both industrialised most effective ones to respond to the challenges and developing countries the european union of globalisation i am not only referring to the need used to call it atypical work but what is becoming to overcome the fragmentation of the movement atypical is permanent regular paid employment because of a multiplicity of organisations who 42 journal of the harvard club of india india at 75 perpetuate political divisions which have already again about the role of general unions in the new become irrelevant organising context who can be our allies in the other questions arise what sense does labour movement i suggest cooperatives we company based unionism make at a time when have to study to what extent a joint action of union companies are merging or are being taken over and cooperatives can be a strategy to impact the so frequently do industrial unions make sense government policies in the new economy at a time when such boundaries are shifting last borders are dissolving in larger political in economic reality and also workers change and economic entities trans border unions is employers several times in their working lives another thought that needs to be considered today with periods of unemployment in between why international unionising has become a necessity should they have to change unions every time they when globalisation imposes stresses on union change employment organisation these will be pressing questions as dan gallin says can we think of one union for women workers in the near future in essence card for life should we not make our organising the informal sector is the future of the labour

1947 nehru ideational constructs embedded in nehru s told his audience one of the notable pan asianist vision which foresaw india and china consequences of the european as the principal poles of a revived asian order and domination of asia has been the isolation of the overlooked the impediments in the way such as countries of asia from one another india always a radical communist movement

india s reconnection with it can at best arm and a leg for today but it remains out of reach be seen as partial south asia today for example is not least because of china s stonewalling of it among the least economically integrated regions there has also been a misreading of history in the world having crawled backwards in some in india with durable consequences the british respects since 1947

models of what india might want to shared nehru s assessment of non alignment and emulate to chart a path out of its relative economic renunciation of geopolitics did not gel because stagnation and the persistence of mass poverty many delegates represented nations already although as noted above this was never a path aligned to one or the other of the cold war blocs that india would adopt uninhibitedly thus not including the people s republic of china who only india s economic policies but also its foreign nehru made a point of inviting to the conference as policy underwent realignment

empowered to demand given the diversity of our population the answers from people in positions of power without indian constitution has set up a few basic rules any fear of retribution our constitution is probably that will ensure that there will always be minimal one of the best in the world but where we lack is coordination among the leaders representing the in the implementation of the laws mentioned in it various strata of society including religion caste this has led to the common man being let down and so on by the system and not receiving the protection that these rules of engagement are important he has a right to by the laws of the land i hope that because without them we will have a situation the republic of india at 73 starts strictly enforcing where people will feel insecure as they will not checks and balances so that the citizens are know what the members of other groups could do protected from powerful people in the government to them india must intensify those mechanisms which will ensure that these rules are our constitution is probably one of the known to society at large and hence best in the world but where we lack is in the provide an assurance to its citizens that implementation of the laws mentioned in it everybody should follow them and in this has led to the common man being let case the rules are not followed they will down by the

kripalani who eventually resigned had many to flex its muscle and enforce a course correction axes to grind with the congress leadership and in the congress his resolve to lead a powerful socialist group despite ideological differences on certain was strengthened by his personal humiliation as issues the socialist group was tied to the party well in his resignation letter he lamented it may because of their unqualified respect for mahatma be due to the fact that all of us are not united on 132 journal of the harvard club of india india at 75 basic policies or it may be that this

with nationalism after all patriotism has prompted pang of nostalgia for one s own patch of land the tens of thousands of people to accept untold space closest to one s own sense of being singing sacrifices even give up their lives for their country of the national anthem at international sporting but while a patriot is prepared to die for his country events the pride in your country s athletes winning the nationalist is willing to kill for his state medals at the olympic games the celebration of scholars across a vast literature have a country s independence day or similar national identified five major elements in nationalism the occasions growing misty eyed over a familiar old yearning for national unity and even uniformity song a garment worn or a typical dish served and the requirement of exclusive loyalty the striving in the admiration expressed for servicemen and for national rather than individual freedom the women for their courage dedication and heroism aspiration for exclusiveness and distinctiveness in keeping a country and its residents safe and the quest for honour and prestige among patriotism is far less ideologically driven than nations this last is where the biggest problem nationalism takes the successes of others in its stride and does not patriotism is far less ideologically involve the same destructive devotion driven than nationalism takes the that nationalism does a patriot loves successes of others in its stride and does his country as he loves his mother not involve the same destructive devotion because he belongs to it and it belongs that nationalism does patriotism versus nationalism 141 lies for this quest for honour and whereas nationalists believe that prestige easily becomes an urge for their nation and what it represents is domination when a nation s dignity unchallengeable patriots love their country requires the defeat of others when not out of misplaced vanity but out of love your honour is seen through the need not just because of its attractiveness but in to assert your superiority to others spite of its flaws nationalism can easily degenerate into chauvinism belligerence and the of every nationalist is to secure more power and rejection of coexistence more prestige not for himself but for the nation whereas nationalists believe that their nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his and what it represents is unchallengeable patriots own individuality love their country not out of misplaced vanity but in my recent book the battle of belonging i out of love not just because of its attractiveness have argued that india s is a civic nationalism but in spite of its flaws patriots can acknowledge anchored in the constitution and its liberal their countries failings and strive to correct them democratic institutions a nationalism of belonging nationalists believe there are none and refuse to rather than of blood speaking for myself when i accept any that are laid out before them as raina refer to my own nationalism spurn any non indian writes patriotism acknowledges that where i live allegiance and proudly wear a tri colour lapel pin is my beloved space warts and all it recognises every day i am really subscribing to a patriotism that our streets are shabby our lanes full of clutter that rests on this conception of india a love of our habits shoddy our resistance to rationality often my country because it is mine anchored in the grossly debilitating our defiance of law a routine institutional and constitutional pillars of civic habit of mind our male chauvinism shameful and nationalism to me indian nationalism derives violent our casteism or racism or communalism its political legitimacy not from ethnicity religion deleterious to the most desirable ideals of human language culture or any of the immutable rights and human oneness patriotism recognises trappings that people acquire from birth but from that things may be better in other countries and the consent and active participation of our citizens yet patriots love their land with all its imperfections as free members of a democratic polity and work to remedy them for our nationalism to rise above the hindi george orwell the english writer articulated hindu tva hindustan idea of india proclaimed by the difference between patriotism and nationalism the present ruling
